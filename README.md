# Personal-Project-Tic-Tac-Toe
Personal project created over the summer of 2019, with the goal of creating a simple implementation
of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe. The current implementation offers a working computer player that 
will draw or win every single game of Tic-Tac-Toe against a human player, following the principles 
from this link:

The goal of this project was to begin to understand game AI with minimax algorithms, with priority based
moves to determine an effective strategy in a game, in this case Tic-Tac-Toe. In the future, I would like
to further delve into minimax algorithms and learn how to create a working AI for a more complcicated game
such as chess or checkers.
